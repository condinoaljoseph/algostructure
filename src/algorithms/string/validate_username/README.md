Implement the validate function, which accepts a username adn returns `true` if it's acceptable and `false` if it's not.

A username is valid if it satisfies the following rules:

-   The username must be at least 6 characters long and not exceed 16 characters.
-   The username must contain only letters, numbers and optionally one hyphen(-).
-   The username must start with a letter, and must not end with a hypen.

For example, `validate("Mike Standish");` would return `false` because it contains a space.
